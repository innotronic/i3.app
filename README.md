# inno IP info

## App
The app queries the devices public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses via our API and displays it together with the corresponding PTR records, AS number(s), as well as the country and description field out of the RIPE database.

The informations are updated each time the app gets in foreground. Or just "pull to refresh".

Each entry can be copied to the clipboard by tapping on it.

Download the app from the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inno-ip-info/id1056812420).


## Project
Look at the project website (http://ip.inno.ch/) for the web app and a CLI tool.

Feedback is much appreciated!
